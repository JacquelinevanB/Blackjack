# Blackjack

This is a fun and simple Blackjack application coded as part of a Java refresher course.
It was based on given rules and conditions.

## What I learned

It was a great way to practice the use of while loops again. 
Learned about the use of `break;` and `continue;`.
The code could be much more elegant, but I'll save that for the next time.
